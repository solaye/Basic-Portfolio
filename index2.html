<p> My name is Stetson Olaye, and I am from the greatest state in the Union. The Lone Star State of Texas.  I am 30 years old and currently based out of Denver, CO where I have resided the past five years. I have a 2-year-old German Shepherd named Lennon after John Lennon. I love basketball, hiking, snowboarding, watching anime, movies, and reruns of Seinfeld. I never met a taco that I didn't like, and could probably say the same thing about beer. Favorite sports teams are as follows:
<br>
<ul>
   <li>New York Knicks</li>
  <li>Houston Texans</li> 
   <li>Houston Astros</li>
   <li>Baylor Bears</li>
   </ul> 
  
   <br>
   I am hoping to become awesome at coding throughout the six months of the program so that I can realize my dreams of world domination (evil laugh).  </p>
